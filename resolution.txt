# in the format `WIDTH x HEIGHT` (whitespace is ignored).
# Any lines starting with the `#` sign are ignored.
# Here are some resolution presets; to use a preset,
# un-comment its line by removing the `#` at the beginning of the line.

# Default resolution, used when no resolution is specified in this file
